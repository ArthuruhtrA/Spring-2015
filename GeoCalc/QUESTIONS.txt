These questions all concern the code in the driver program, geocalc.rb

Consider the first executable line:

   $stdin.each do | line; figure, command, x0, y0, x1, y1, p1, p2 |

1. (1 point) What is passed to the 'line' variable by the each method?

2. (1 point) What is the purpose of the semi-colon (';') and the list of
   identifiers that follow it. You'll have to look this up in the Ruby
   on-line documentation.

3. (1 point) The syntax of commands is given in the comments at the head
   of the file, namely:

   C,X0,Y0,X1,Y1

   Given this, what does line.split(',') do? Hint: you need to look up the
   split method for class String in the Ruby documentation.

4. (1 point) The complete statment using line.split(',') is:

   command, x0, y0, x1, y1 = line.split(',')

   This is an example of Ruby's multiple assignment construct. Look up how
   multiple assignment works and describe how multiple assignment, in
   combination with line.split(','), ends up assigning the command character
   and the four points to the appropriate variables on the left side of '='.

5. (2 points) Describe how the case statement works in terms of how it
   executes the proper code for each command.
