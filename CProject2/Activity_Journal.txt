Home Security "C" Project - Part 2

Name: Ari Sanders

===========  Makefile ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 05
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I will write the file and see if it works. If not, I will change based on
 previous Makefiles. Repeat until it works.
Estimation was based on the fact that it doesn't take long to write a Makefile.

Complete
Actual Time	00 05
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
It worked.

===========  Level 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
First, I'll write the code for the main loop. Next step is to write the code
 to parse an event. Finally, write the code to make a new event. Throughout,
 as I finish a function, I will attempt to compile to ensure it is functional.
At this point, testing can begin. I will input the level one test file. If it
 works, I'll move on to level two. I know I should test other things, but I'm
 short on time. If it does not compile, I will use gdb to find the error. If it
 does, I will look through my code intensely, changing things that don't look
 right, comparing things to previous code, checking against the internet, until
 I find the faulty code and fix it.
Estimation was done somewhat randomly. I don't have a sense of time, so I
 guess. I didn't finish the first part of the project, so I have no point of
 comparison. And C takes me longer than Ruby did, because it's more complicated
 and refuses to work for me. Plus I hate printing things in C, so I avoid doing
 that in my debugging process.

Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Well, I of course underestimated that. I also took way too long to solve simple
 problems and got distracted a lot.
I learned to re-read the instructions when something doesn't work right.
I encountered some weird issues with pointers, of course. Also one where I was
 adding my nodes to the wrong end of the list.

===========  Level 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I just have to modify the previous code slightly to add this. Shouldn't take
 long.
I will add the two necessary functions first, then modify the parser.

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)
