===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
First, I will have it print what it reads. When I know this is correct, I will then have it parse the data, and print the result of that.
To test, I will run the provided test files and ensure I am getting the same output I've been told I should. If not, additional tests may be devised to determine the error.
To be honest, I have neither a sense of time nor the ability to estimate how long something takes. Therefore, I picked a number (30 minutes) and am hoping this is the right number.

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)
